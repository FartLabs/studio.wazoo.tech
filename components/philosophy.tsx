          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl leading-relaxed">
            We believe design isn't decoration — it's persuasion. When a
            portfolio feels effortless, it builds trust, and trust drives
            inquiries and sales.

              By grounding design in behavioral data, we help artists achieve
              their goals without losing their aesthetic integrity. Our work
              consistently increases contact form submissions, e-commerce
              conversions, and client inquiries not by pushing harder, but by
              removing friction and making the path from visitor to client feel
              natural.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                We build portfolio sites and ecommerce stores that merge
                thoughtful design with measurable outcomes. We help artists,
                photographers, and creative professionals improve how their work
                is represented online, through clear UX, strong hierarchy, and
                visuals that convert visitors into clients—without cheap tricks.

              <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                We work with artists, photographers, illustrators, and creative
                professionals who value good design as much as good results. Our
                best partnerships come from creatives who understand their
                audience deeply but need a technical-creative partner to turn
                that understanding into a high-performing portfolio that gets
                more clients and sells more art.
